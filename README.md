Instruction Manual for the Digital Inclusion Website
	

Purpose of the Website


The purpose of this website is 1) to inform the user of the different programs in the San José Digital Inclusion Fund and 2) to collect user data that can be helpful when matching the user to a grantee. The website aims to achieve these through a journey map that has clear steps for the user to follow. The ultimate goal is to make it as simple as possible for the user to access information and resources that might be of help to them. 

**For more detailed information about the research done for designing the website, refer to the final presentation file.**

Main Components of the Website


On the top of the website, there is a section that helps the user determine if they need to go through the Journey Map. If they are looking for either low-cost internet packages, computer and internet lessons, or free access to digital devices, they are in the right place and should go through the Journey Map. If they are looking for something else, they can simply jump to Step 4 of the Journey Map to contact the staff. 
There are four steps in the Journey Map: 1) “Explore Our Programs”, 2) “See What You Are Eligible For”, 3) “Learn More About the Grantees”, and 4) “Any Questions?”. By clicking on the first step, a pop-up page would appear with information about the access programs, the digital literacy trainings, and the device programs. Each of the circles in this page is linked to the website of its corresponding programs. The second step is linked to a three-page questionnaire that asks the user a series of questions about their basic information and their digital needs. Upon finishing the questionnaire, the user would see a congratulations page. By clicking on the third step, the user would be directed to a webpage with the full list of grantees. In the fourth step, there would be a message box that allows the user to ask any questions they might have.
